# Rules According to Punch
I like short, descriptive little "rules" that help guide me through
various tasks. For this course these are some useful such rules. They
aren't test material, you don't have to memorize them, but I think
they can be helpful. We can all add to them as we go along (feel free
to offer your thoughts).

- "Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at
  death", A. Einstein
  - 3 places to be: in front of the wave, behind the wave, riding the wave.
- "We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are", Anais Nin
- Algorithms are **everything**
  - making a bad algorithm parallel makes a bad parallel algorithm.
- "Typing is no substitute for thinking", Dartmouth Basic Manual, 1964
  - Don't be a dung beetle programmer
- Time is relative
- Fast is last
- You only have to make the slow parts fast
