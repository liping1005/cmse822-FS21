# CMSE 822, FS21
## Parallel Programming

### Background:
Calculus at the level of MTH 133. Ability to program proficiently in
C/C++, basic understanding of data structures and algorithms (both at
the level of CSE 232). Basic linear algebra and differential
equations.

### Description:
Core principles, techniques, and use of parallel computation using
modern supercomputers. Parallel architectures. Parallel programming
models. Principles of parallel algorithm design. Performance analysis
and optimization. 

### Objectives

The focus of the coures will be:

*   Learn introductory concepts of parallel programming
*   Briefly review C++ programming and related issues (build, profile,
    optimize, etc.)
*   Review basic hardware/software issues that affect parallel programming
*   Work with existing tools for programming threads, shared memory,
    distributed memory and SIMD (GPU)
*   Apply what we learn to some basic problems in physics, CS and
    other sciences to see how well we can speed up calculation.

### Course Web Site

I try to run all of the course material out of the CMSE 822 at:
[https://github.com/msu-cmse-courses/cmse822-FS21](https://github.com/msu-cmse-courses/cmse822-FS21). Check
there for announcements, resources and the like
  
Discussion boards will also be on Slack at
[https://cmse-courses.slack.com/archives/C029BK8HJFR](https://cmse-courses.slack.com/archives/C029BK8HJFR). This
is a good place to ask questions as I, the TA and your fellow
classmates can all see it and try to answer.

### Course Textbook


 [![book cover image](primer.jpg) **C++ Primer, 5th Ed.**](http://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Edition-Stanley-Lippman/dp/0321714113/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377287553&sr=8-1&keywords=c%2B%2B+primer) by Lippman, Lajoie, Moo. ISBN-13:978-0321714114 . This is an ** _ optional _ ** book, though very useful as a reference.

Mimir
-----

[Mimir](class.mimir.io) is a **_required_** element for the class. Much of your programming work will be turned in via Mimir. [Lab 00](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/Weekly/week00/lab/lab00.html) sets up for registering for Mimir.

Mimir gives you two weeks grace period before you are required to pay $25 for the semester. Mimir is a **_required_** registration for the course.

No Lectures
-----------

As of FS 17, CSE 232 has no lectures. Students attend a 2 hour recitation/laboratory session based on their Section number. There are also a set of students who even do the laboratory exercises strictly online.

Laboratory Sessions
-------------------

The computing laboratory for CSE 232 is located in 3345 Engineering; attendance at scheduled laboratory sessions is mandatory. Missing laboratory sessions will reduce your final grade (see below).  
  
The two-hour scheduled laboratory sessions are coordinated by Teaching Assistants, and are used to complete laboratory exercises and to consult with Teaching Assistants about other aspects of the course, e.g. projects.  
  
The laboratory exercises are designed to be learning tools that complement the lectures and assigned readings. They are designed to be collaborative experiences where students work with each other and the Teaching Assistant to complete the lab exercises. Students who are habitually late will not receive credit when they arrive late to lab.

Course Grades
-------------

Each student's course grade will be based on the sum of the points earned in the following categories:  
  

Examinations

(50% of total course points)

Computer Projects

(45% of total course points)

Exercises (in-class)

(5% of total course points)

  
To be eligible to earn a non-zero grade in the course, a student normally must do ALL the following:

1.  miss no more than two (2) labs,
2.  earn at least 50% of the total points for the computer projects, and
3.  earn at least 50% of the total points for the examinations.

The following table gives the scale for course grades:  
  

4.0

90% of points available

3.5

85% of points available

3.0

80% of points available

2.5

75% of points available

2.0

70% of points available

1.5

65% of points available

1.0

60% of points available

  
The instructor reserves the right to adjust the scale for course grades, if necessary.  
  
**Important:** Students who miss more than two (2) laboratory assignments will have their final grade _reduced_ by _0.5 for each laboratory assignment missed_: if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but misses four (4) laboratory assignments, that student's grade will be reduced by 2\*0.5 to a 2.0 final grade. Contact your instructor, if you have any concerns about your performance in the class.

Important Dates
---------------

See: [Academic Calendar 2018/18](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Calendar/academic.aspx) for complete dates, but note that:

*   the last day to add a class without intervention: September 5th
*   the last day to drop with a full refund: September 24th
*   the last day a student can drop with no grade: October 17th

Common Night Exams
------------------

Two midterm examinations and a final examination will be conducted during the semester, and will constitute 45% of the total course points. **These are a common night exam** , see the schedule below. You will be allowed one sheet of notes (8.5x11 inches) both sides, but no electronic devices. Non-native English speakers may bring a paper dictionary.  
  
For on-campus students these exams will be in-class exams held during the regular class times at the assigned lecture hall.

*   Midterm Exam #1 (15%) **Thur, Oct 4th, 7pm** , ANH 1281
*   Midterm Exam #2 (15%) **Fri, Nov 9th, 6pm** , ANH 1281
*   Final Exam (20%) **Wed, Dec 12th, 8pm-10pm** ANH 1281

All issues related to the final examination will follow the policies and schedule of the University: [MSU Final Exam Schedule](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Calendar/FinalExam.aspx).

Pre-lab exercises
-----------------

Each week there will be one pre-lab exercise to warm you up for the week to come. These are online exercises. These exercises will not be graded, only marked on your reports as

*   1 Done.
*   0 Not Done.

Computer Projects
-----------------

Eleven computer projects will be assigned, and will constitute 45% of the total course points. The projects will include the design and implementation of solutions using C++. Project solutions are submitted electronically via the [Mimir](class.mimir.io)  
  
Computer Projects are to be done individually. Discussing problem-solving strategies with other students is encouraged, **but _as soon as the discussion turns to a particular implementation that must be done on your own._**  
  
Each project solution is electronically compared to all other solutions to identify similar solutions. Individuals that submit solutions that are essentially identical will receive a score of zero for that assignment, and will be reported to their Dean. A student who is involved in a second such incident of academic dishonesty will receive a grade of zero in the course. Since the comparison is done off campus, to protect your privacy do not include your name or PID in your project solution.  
  
_**Under no circumstances should you share a project solution with another student. Simply showing your solution to another student almost guarantees a zero score: past experience shows that a student who asks to "look at" your solution will copy parts of it or pass it along to someone else who copies it.**_  
  

Important Project Notes
-----------------------

*   **On Time** Projects must be turned in on time. Mimir allows you to turn in a project up to 24hours late with a 50% reduction in points. After 24hours, no projects can be turned in without previous notice to the instructor or sudden, documentable, emergencies.
*   **Test Cases** When you turn in a project to Mimir, you receive feedback on whether you code compiled and the test cases you passed. In this way you should always know how you are doing on the programming projects.

Notes
-----

The instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course calendar, and assignment specifications.  
  
Any extenuating circumstances that impact on your participation in the course should be discussed with your lecture instructor as soon as those circumstances are known (such as absences due to illness, religious observances, or other required school activities).  
  
All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system provided for this course. Account usage guidelines published by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering are posted under: [Acceptable Use Policy](http://www.cse.msu.edu/Facility/Policies/AUP.php)  
  

### Important Course Policies

1.  Make-ups for examinations may be arranged, if your absence is caused by a documented illness or personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting documentation) must be submitted to your lecture instructor; if the explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged. When possible, make-up arrangements should be completed in advance.
2.  A student who is unable to complete a computer project by the specified due date because of illness or a personal emergency should contact his or her lecture instructor. If the student's explanation is acceptable, the assignment due date will be extended (or his or her lecture instructor will make other appropriate arrangements).
3.  A student is allowed to miss up to two scheduled laboratory sessions without penalty so illness or personal emergency can be accommodated without needing to notify us. If a long-term illness or personal emergency consumes more than two, the student needs to contact his or her lecture instructor.
4.  To be eligible for credit, each solution to a computer project must fulfill the published requirements, must be submitted by the published due date, and must be your own work.
5.  The Department of Computer Science and Engineering expects all students to adhere to MSU's policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which includes the statement, ".... all academic work will be done by the student to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind". The complete text of the University policy is posted under: [University Policy on the Integrity of Scholarship and Grades](https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html) . Students who violate this policy may receive a failing grade in the course.
6.  Students requiring accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) with [MSU's Resource Centers for Disabilities (RCPD)](http://www.rcpd.msu.edu/) should bring their Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form to the instructor as near the beginning of the term as possible.
7.  Extensive Teaching Assistant help is provided for this course,the college of Engineering's [CoRe](http://www.egr.msu.edu/core/residential/tutoring) experience coordinate volunteer and paid tutoring assistance available to all students for many common classes, including CSE 232.
8.  Accommodations will be made for religious observances if requests are made well in advance. Since religious observances are usually known at the beginning of class and assignment due dates are in this syllabus, we expect students to request accommodation at the beginning of the semester. See MSU's policy on [Religious Observance](https://reg.msu.edu/ROInfo/Notices/ReligiousPolicy.aspx) for more details.
