# Day 03 Preclass

### Background Slides
These are background slides I have from various places. I didn't do much to edit them and not everything is that relevant, but take a look.
- [c-arrays](c-arrays.pdf)
- [2D arrays](2Darray.pdf)
### Example Code
This is stuff that went with the slides
- [arrays](arrays.cpp)
- [array ptrs](aryptrs.cpp)
- [array functions](aryFunctions.cpp)
- [2d arrays](2darray.c)

### Video to watch

[Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLn57VrGAA) You
don't need to know all of this but it's only 5 minutes and worth
taking a look at. 

## Read

In the Intro to HPC book,  Sections 1.3 and 1.4
