## Day 9 preclass
## Video to watch
Nothing I really liked. 
## Read
Look at the slides:
- [tasks](task_parallelism.pdf)

Look at the code exercises as well:
- [Ex 1](3.1-async1.cpp)
- [Ex 2](3.2-async2.cpp)
- [Ex 3](3.3-async3.cpp)
- [collatz](collatz.cpp)
## Turn in
Answer the following questions:
1. What's the default launch flag for an async
2. Give two advantages of the future data structure
2. Can you find some discussion online concerning  challenges associated with async?
## Day 09 Inclass
Ah, the beloved [t-vector](t-vector-2.cpp) example. Modify it now to work with the async model.
