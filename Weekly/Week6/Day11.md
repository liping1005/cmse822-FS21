## Read
We are in the [Eijkhout Parallel Programming book]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/EijkhoutParallelProgramming.pdf) now. This link is to a .pdf copy of the book so we get our references right. You only need to download it once.

Read chapter 18 (only 7 pages)
Read chapter 19 up to 19.2
Read chapter 20 (only 6 pages)

Look at the slides:
- [openmp2](OpenMP2.pdf)

Look at the code exercises as well:

- [trap-for](trap-for.cpp)
## Turn in
Answer the following questions:
- page 457 C++ example uses a `stringstream`. What is it and why use it?
- how can you get thread local storage (what do you need to do)?
- 

## Day 11 Inclass

Let's do exercise 18.4 (pg 459)

Perhaps we could also "sum the thread ids" using a for loop reduction.
