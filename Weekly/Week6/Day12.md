-[openmp sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcPZLJKtywc&t=0s&index=9&list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG)

## Read
We are in the [Eijkhout Parallel Programming book]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/EijkhoutParallelProgramming.pdf) now. This link is to a .pdf copy of the book so we get our references right. You only need to download it once.

Read chapter 23 through 23.3.1

Look at the slides:
- [openmp sync](OpenMPsync.pdf)

Look at the code exercises as well:
- [barrier](barrier.cpp)
- [lock](lock.cpp)
- [order-collapse](collapse-order.cpp)
- [nowait](nowait.cpp)

## Turn in
Answer the following questions:
Exercise 23.1 asks about doing a critical section vs an atomic vs a reduction for the for loop. Which do you think would be more efficient and why? What would the drawbacks be?

## Day 12 Inclass

Work on our homework.
