## Day 14
One of the suggestions I got was that perhaps some "flash"
 topics introduced occassionally would be useful. I like that and I think I'll try and do that as the course goes on. I'll do one such topic today on functions and templates and will do some more as we go forward.
 
I will also leave time today at the end of class to discuss Final Project topics.


# Preclass 14
## Videos to watch
A Git introduction was not the most highly rated option, but here are a series of videos (made by Dirk Colbry of CMSE) that you might find useful. Look at them if you like.

## Slides


Look at the slides:
- [functions and templates](funs.pdf)

Look at the code examples as well:
- [6.5](06.5-func_sigs.cpp)
- [6.6](06.6-matching.cpp)
- [6.7](06.7-templateFunction.cpp)
- [6.8](06.8-forceTemplate.cpp)


## Preclass Turn in
Write a simple templated function that takes two arguments (of the same type) and adds them together. Write a main to show it off, turn in the program.

## Day 14 Inclass

We'll do the function stuff then talk about projects.
