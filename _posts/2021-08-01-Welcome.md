Welcome to CMSE 822

Most of the information can be found at the top of the web page:

* CMSE822 gets you to the home page
* Schedule gets you to the weekly work, updated every week. I'll try
  to get things up at the end of the week before the work is due
* Resources are links to elements that might be helpful. In particular
  it has a link to the two online books. I'll update this as we go
  along.
* Syllabus is what it says, the layout of the course

Under the *What's New* banner I'll try to list out changes as they
occur.
