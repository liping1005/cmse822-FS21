OK, we are off and running. You can see the two days coming this
week. I try to put all material for the coming week off of the pages
for those two Days.

You are asked to do the pre-class **before** the class and turn it
into D2L. There is a time set for the pre-class that ends at about the
time the class begins. Please get the pre-class done and handed in
before class.

There is an inclass as well each day. We would prefer that you hold
off on doing in in-class by yourself and instead do the work together,
as a group, during the class period. However feel free to look at the
material and get familiar with the information. 

- [Day1](/Weekly/Week1/Day1) 
- [Day2](/Weekly/Week1/Day2) 

If you haven't filled out the survey, make sure you do that now.

Finally, all the material for this class is available as a git page at https://msu-cmse-courses/cmse822-FS21 . You can download this anytime.
