## Changeup

We talked about this in class today. I'm going to move coding exercises out of the inclass work and make them homeworks. The goal is to give you more time to work on these exercises and be able to work on them and ask questions during class. The result will be:
- the inclass will be based on attendance and working in class rather than turning code in. Still worth 10% of the overall grade
- there will be more homeworks, around 11-12, each being given a week to do them. In total, the homeworks will be worth 50%

Below is a link to the first homework, due in D2L by 9/16.
