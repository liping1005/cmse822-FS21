As before, I will try to put up all the material the weekend before anything is due. 

As we discussed in class on Thur, a change in how things will go. There is still a pre-class and that will be due around the time class begins.

The in-class work will now be more discussion and working on homeworks. I intend now to distribute 11-12 smaller homeworks so that we will gain more experience.
