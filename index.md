## Welcome to CMSE 822, Parallel Computing, FS 21
This is a graduate level course introducing topics associated with
Parallel Computing. We will focus on fundamental issues with Parallel
Computing (threading, mutex, hardware, etc.), examine the use of
exisiting tools (C++ threading, OpenMP, MPI, cuda, etc.) and
apply what we learn to practical problems.
